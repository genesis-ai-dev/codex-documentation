## Overview

While you can translate cell by cell in Codex, batch translation allows you to leverage AI to queue up multiple cells at once for autocompletion, significantly speeding up your translation workflow.

## Selecting Cells to Translate

When setting up a batch translation, you can choose from different cell types:

- **Empty cells with no content** - Cells that are completely empty
- **Not validated by any user** - Cells that haven't been reviewed by anyone yet
- **Not validated by you** - Cells you haven't personally validated
- **Fully validated by others** - Cells that have been validated by other team members

You can select the specific number of cells you want to translate at once, or use the "All" button to translate all cells matching your criteria.

## Running a Batch Translation

1. Select your desired cell type criteria
2. Choose the number of cells to translate
3. Click to start the batch translation
4. The system will queue up the selected cells and process them with AI

Note that the system will skip cells without content, so the cell count may appear to jump (e.g., from 9 to 11 if cell 10 was empty).

## Reviewing AI Translations

After the AI generates translations, it's important to review them as a human to verify accuracy:

- Check each translation for errors or issues
- Edit the text manually if needed
- Click the validation button if the translation looks good

## Validation Settings

Configure your validation settings in the top left corner:

- Set the number of validators required (e.g., 2 or 3)
- Track who has validated which cells
- Monitor which translations have passed review

Audio recording validations are also available, though they work separately from text validations.

## How AI Improves Over Time

The AI adapts to your translation tendencies as you make progress:

- The more you translate and validate, the better the AI becomes
- Your editing patterns help train the AI for more accurate suggestions
- Later translations will be more aligned with your style

## Automatic Validation

When you edit a cell in the dialog box, it's automatically validated by you. The system assumes that if you've entered and edited a cell, you've reviewed it.

If you're uncertain about a translation even after editing, you can remove your validation by clicking the delete button next to the validation indicator.

## Best Practices

- Start with smaller batches to review AI quality
- Consistently validate translations to improve AI learning
- Use the validation system to track team progress
- Remove validations when uncertain rather than leaving potentially incorrect validations in place
