The AI Copilot uses project-level instructions to guide translations. Proper configuration ensures the AI produces results aligned with your translation goals.

## Accessing Copilot Settings

1. Open Project Settings from the main menu.
2. Click on the 'Co-pilot Settings' button.

## Generating Initial Instructions

If no settings exist, click the button to generate initial instructions.

- The system loads instructions on how to accurately translate from your source to target language (e.g., English to French).
- You may see a loading indicator at the bottom.

<Callout type="warning">
If you change languages, regenerate these instructions.
</Callout>

## Customizing Instructions

You can add or modify instructions to specify your preferences.

For example, if translating a Bible:
- Specify the style, e.g., 'The style of Bible we want to translate is like the Living Bible - contemporary and easy to understand.'
- Address terminology: 'There will be some terminology that readers won't be familiar with until they read more of the Bible itself. I don't want it to reword every technical term, but I do want it to be contemporary.'

Think of these instructions in the same way as instructions you'd give a human translator on your project.

## Saving and Applying Changes

1. Edit the instructions in the text area.
2. Click 'Save' to apply them to your project.
3. The AI will use these for all future predictions and generations.

## Best Practices

- Regenerate instructions if you change languages.
- Keep instructions clear and specific, focusing on style, terminology, and context.
- Test with sample translations after updates.
- Share instructions with team members for consistency.

## Troubleshooting

- If instructions don't appear or load, try regenerating.
- Ensure your language settings are correct in Project Settings.
