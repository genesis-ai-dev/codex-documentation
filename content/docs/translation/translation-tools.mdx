Once you're in Codex and have imported your source files, you're ready to begin translating.

## Accessing Your Translation Files

There are two ways to navigate to your translations:

1. **Open Translation Files** directly from your dashboard
2. **Navigation Button** in the top left corner where you can see:
   - Your imported source files
   - Progress bars for text translation
   - Progress bars for audio translation

## The Translation Interface

The interface displays:
- **Source text** on the left (the text you're translating from)
- **Target translation** on the right (your translation)

## Translating Verses

### Manual Translation

Click on a verse and start typing your translation directly.

### AI-Assisted Translation

1. Click on a verse
2. Click the **Sparkle button** to autocomplete with AI

The AI uses your prompt settings (configured in AI settings from the main menu) and will translate based on your project configuration.

**Important**: The AI will improve over time as you make edits. It learns from your corrections and preferences. Sometimes it will offer two options and ask which you prefer, continuously learning to match your translation style.

## Batch Translation

To translate multiple cells at once using AI:

1. Click the **Sparkle button** at the top of the interface
2. Select the cell type criteria:
   - Empty cells with no content
   - Not validated by any user
   - Not validated by you
   - Fully validated by others
3. Choose the number of cells to translate (or use "All" to translate all matching cells)
4. The AI will queue and autocomplete the selected cells

The AI improves over time as it learns from your edits and corrections, making subsequent batch translations more accurate.

## Translation Tools

Each verse has access to powerful editing tools:

### Text & Formatting Tools
- **Show Edit History**: View all changes made to a verse
- **Add Child Cells**: Create sub-cells for complex translations
- **Add Paratextual Cells**: Add notes or context
- **Change Styling and Indentation**: Format your text
- **See Tags**: View markup and formatting tags
- **Look at Source Text**: Reference where the translation came from

### Advanced Features
- **Generate Back Translation**: Create a reverse translation for quality checking
- **Add Footnotes**: Include translator notes and references

### Audio Tools
- **Record Audio**: Record audio for your translation
- **Play Audio**: Listen to recorded audio
- **Audio History**: View previous audio recordings
- **Rerecord/Remove Audio**: Manage your recordings
- **Transcribe**: Generate text from audio
- **Validate Audio**: Mark audio as approved

## Validation System

### How Validation Works

Each verse shows a **blank circle** that you can click to validate. Validation tracking shows:
- Which verses have been validated
- Who performed the validation

### Validation Settings

Configure validations in **Project Settings** (accessed from the main menu in the top left):

- **Required Validations for Text**: Set to 1 (default) or higher for collaborative review
- **Required Validations for Audio**: Can be set independently (e.g., 3 if you have dedicated audio reviewers)

**Note**: You cannot validate verses that have no text content. Audio can be validated independently.

### Collaborative Validation

You can change required validations to 2 or more to enable collaborative review where you and your translation partner both validate translations together.

## Best Practices

- **Let the AI Learn**: The AI improves as you make edits and corrections
- **Validate Consistently**: Use the validation system to track progress and quality
- **Use Batch Translation**: Speed up initial drafts for large sections
- **Review AI Suggestions**: Always review and edit AI translations for accuracy
- **Leverage Audio Features**: Record and validate audio translations for multimedia projects
