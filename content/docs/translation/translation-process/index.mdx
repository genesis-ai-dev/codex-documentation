Once your project is set up, you can begin translating using AI predictions and manual editing.

## Starting Translation

There are two ways to start:
1. From the welcome page, click 'Open Translation File'.
2. From the side panel, go to the main menu and click on 'My Translations'.

You'll see groups like Old Testament and New Testament (based on what you've downloaded). Select a testament and book, e.g., New Testament > Mark.

The interface shows the source text on the left and target translation on the right.

## Manual Editing

Click on a verse to edit and write your own translation in the target language (e.g., French).

## Generating AI Predictions

To use AI:
1. Click on a verse.
2. Click the sparkle button to generate a prediction.

Initial predictions may not be optimal as the AI uses language info and project instructions but lacks examples of your translation style. You may see a warning about no examples.

The AI can still translate effectively, especially for well-supported languages like French, and will learn to translate lower resource languages as you give it more translation data.

## Editing and Validating Translations

- Review the AI prediction.
- Make changes if needed (e.g., adjust capitalization for consistency, add quotation marks).
- Click the checkmark to accept and validate.

Checkmarks show who validated the translation (e.g., your username).

Predictions without checkmarks are unvalidated AI suggestions. Validate by reading and approving.

If no changes needed, click to apply validation.

## Batch Translation

To predict multiple versesbased., 3) and autocomplete.

Review generated translations. Accept good ones, re-predict others by selecting 'Translate Cells with No Validation'.

## Additional Features

- **Messages**: Many messages appear at the bottom. Press Escape to clear, or turn off debug mode (if enabled) by unchecking the box.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same chapter; changes are reconciled automatically.
- **Verse History**: Click the history button on a verse to view changes. Revert to older versions, make additional changes, or drop changes.

## Best Practices

- Provide examples through validations to improve AI predictions.
- Maintain consistency in edits.
- Validate all AI predictions for quality.

## Troubleshooting

- If predictions are poor, check project instructions and provide more examples.
- For excessive messages, disable debug mode.
