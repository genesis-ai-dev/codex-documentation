<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={0} title="Introduction to Back Translation" />

- Explanation of back translation as a process that is not done all at once.
- Emphasis on steering the back translation as you go, similar to translating in Codex.

### 2. Accessing the Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={15} title="Accessing the Translation" />

- Click on the first verse that has been translated.
- View the translation and the source text at the bottom and left in context.

### 3. Generating the Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={24} title="Generating the Back Translation" />

- Click on the back translation tab, which initially shows no back translation.
- Click the refresh button to generate the back translation.

### 4. Reviewing the Back Translation

- The generated back translation will be in the source language (English).
- Note that initial back translations may come in English even if another language is desired.

### 5. Editing the Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={64} title="Editing the Back Translation" />

- Edit the back translation to reflect how you would translate the text.
- Save the edited back translation.

### 6. Learning from Previous Back Translations

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={75} title="Learning from Previous Back Translations" />

- The AI will learn from the back translations you have previously made.
- This helps improve future back translations.

### 7. Including Phrase Level Notes

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={86} title="Including Phrase Level Notes" />

- Back translations should include specific phrase level notes.
- These notes can assist in evaluating the translation and provide extra detail.

### 8. Continuing with Subsequent Verses

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={108} title="Continuing with Subsequent Verses" />

- Move on to the next verse and repeat the back translation process.
- The system will continue to learn from your previous inputs.

### 9. Ongoing Quality Assurance

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={126} title="Ongoing Quality Assurance" />

- Back translation can be integrated into the quality assurance process.
- It does not need to be completed all at once, allowing for continuous improvement.
