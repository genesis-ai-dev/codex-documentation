## Creating a Back Translation

### 1. Introduction to Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={0} title="Introduction to Back Translation" />

- Explanation of back translation as a process that is not done all at once.
- Emphasis on steering the back translation as you go, similar to translating in Codex.

### 2. Accessing the Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={15} title="Accessing the Translation" />

- Click on the first verse that has been translated.
- View the translation and the source text at the bottom and left in context.

### 3. Generating the Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={24} title="Generating the Back Translation" />

- Click on the back translation tab, which initially shows no back translation.
- Click the refresh button to generate the back translation.

### 4. Reviewing the Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={36} title="Reviewing the Back Translation" />

- The generated back translation will be in the source language (English).
- Note that initial back translations may come in English even if another language is desired.

### 5. Editing the Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={64} title="Editing the Back Translation" />

- Edit the back translation to reflect how you would translate the text.
- Save the edited back translation.

### 6. Learning from Previous Back Translations

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={75} title="Learning from Previous Back Translations" />

- The AI will learn from the back translations you have previously made.
- This helps improve future back translations.

### 7. Including Phrase Level Notes

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={86} title="Including Phrase Level Notes" />

- Back translations should include specific phrase level notes.
- These notes can assist in evaluating the translation and provide extra detail.

### 8. Continuing with Subsequent Verses

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={108} title="Continuing with Subsequent Verses" />

- Move on to the next verse and repeat the back translation process.
- The system will continue to learn from your previous inputs.

### 9. Ongoing Quality Assurance

<LoomVideo videoId="645a1650b24b48cb9e0cdcf5539d5d43" timestamp={126} title="Ongoing Quality Assurance" />

- Back translation can be integrated into the quality assurance process.
- It does not need to be completed all at once, allowing for continuous improvement.

## Changing Language for Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="3c53ec93e87a49aab54e93eb46879f74" timestamp={0} title="Changing Language for Back Translation" />

### Objective

This SOP outlines the steps to change the source language for back translation in Codex, ensuring accurate translations based on the selected source language.

## Step 1: Access the Source Text

<LoomVideo videoId="3c53ec93e87a49aab54e93eb46879f74" timestamp={0} title="Access the Source Text" />

- For example, open the book of Jonah, chapter 1, verse 1.
- Locate the source text at the bottom of the cell.

## Step 2: Generate Initial Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="3c53ec93e87a49aab54e93eb46879f74" timestamp={18} title="Generate Initial Back Translation" />

- Click on the 'Back Translation' button to generate the initial back translation.
- Review the generated back translation and notes.

## Step 3: Change Source Language

<LoomVideo videoId="3c53ec93e87a49aab54e93eb46879f74" timestamp={32} title="Change Source Language" />

- Identify the current source language (e.g., Arabic).
- Change the source language to the desired language (e.g., English).

## Step 4: Regenerate Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="3c53ec93e87a49aab54e93eb46879f74" timestamp={63} title="Regenerate Back Translation" />

- Click to regenerate the back translation after changing the source language.
- Note that the back translation may still show the previous language.

## Step 5: Delete Previous Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="3c53ec93e87a49aab54e93eb46879f74" timestamp={84} title="Delete Previous Back Translation" />

- Delete the existing back translation completely.

## Step 6: Save Changes

<LoomVideo videoId="3c53ec93e87a49aab54e93eb46879f74" timestamp={100} title="Save Changes" />

- Save the changes made after deleting the back translation.

## Step 7: Final Regeneration of Back Translation

<LoomVideo videoId="3c53ec93e87a49aab54e93eb46879f74" timestamp={124} title="Final Regeneration of Back Translation" />

- Click to regenerate the back translation again.
- Verify that the back translation now reflects the new source language.

### Cautionary Notes

- Ensure that you have saved any important data before deleting the back translation.
- Double-check the source language setting before regenerating the back translation to avoid confusion.

### Tips for Efficiency

- Familiarize yourself with the interface to quickly navigate between steps.
- Keep a note of the languages you frequently use to streamline the process.
