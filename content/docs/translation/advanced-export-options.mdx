description: Learn about all available export formats in Codex Editor including round-trip workflows for Word, InDesign, and specialized formats
---

Beyond the basic export formats (Plain Text, HTML, USFM), Codex Editor offers powerful advanced export options including round-trip workflows that preserve formatting and structure. These options let you move seamlessly between Codex and other professional tools.

## Understanding Export Types

### Standard Exports

These formats create simple, readable outputs:

- **Plain Text** - Clean text without formatting
- **HTML** - For web viewing or publishing
- **USFM** - Standard Bible translation format

### Round-Trip Exports

These formats preserve complete structure for editing and re-import:

- **DOCX Round-trip** - Export back to Microsoft Word with formatting
- **IDML Round-trip** - Export to InDesign for layout work
- **OBS Markdown** - Export Bible stories with images
- **VTT/SRT** - Export translated subtitles
- **Biblica Format** - Specialized publishing format

### Rebuild Export (Intelligent Detection)

Automatically detects the original import format and exports accordingly:

- Detects DOCX round-trip files → exports to DOCX
- Detects IDML files → exports to IDML
- Detects OBS files → exports to Markdown
- Detects subtitle files → exports to VTT/SRT
- Falls back to appropriate format for others

## Accessing Export Options

1. Open **Project Settings** from the sidebar menu
2. Scroll to **Export Project** section
3. Choose your desired export format
4. Select the file(s) to export
5. Choose save location
6. Wait for export to complete

<Callout type="info">
**Quick Tip:** Use "Rebuild Export" when you're not sure which format to use. It automatically detects the right format based on how the file was imported.

## Using Rebuild Export

The **Rebuild Export** feature intelligently detects the original file type and exports to the appropriate format automatically.

### How It Works

1. Reads cell metadata to detect importer type
2. Determines original file format
3. Routes to appropriate exporter
4. Preserves structure and formatting
5. Returns file in original format

### Supported Auto-Detection

| Importer Used | Auto-Detected Export |
|---------------|---------------------|
| DOCX Round-trip | DOCX with formatting |
| IDML/Biblica | IDML format |
| OBS Markdown | OBS Markdown |
| VTT/SRT | Subtitle format |
| USFM | USFM format |
| Plain text | Plain text |
| Others | Best-fit format |

### When to Use

- **Mixed projects** with multiple file types
- **Unsure** which format to choose
- **Batch exports** of different file types
- **Quick exports** without format selection

### Example Workflow

1. Project with:
   - 3 DOCX files (round-trip)
   - 2 OBS stories
   - 1 subtitle file
2. Select **"Rebuild Export"**
3. Choose all 6 files
4. System automatically:
   - Exports DOCX files to Word format
   - Exports OBS to Markdown
   - Exports subtitle to VTT
5. Download 6 properly-formatted files!

<Callout type="info">
**Time Saver:** Rebuild Export is perfect for projects with multiple file types. Select all your files at once and let Codex figure out the right format for each one.
</Callout>

## Batch Export

Export multiple files simultaneously:

### Single Format Batch

1. Choose export format (e.g., "Plain Text")
2. Select multiple `.codex` files
3. Click export
4. All files exported to the same format
5. Download as individual files or ZIP

### Mixed Format Batch (Rebuild Export)

1. Choose "Rebuild Export"
2. Select files of different types
3. System detects each file's format
4. Exports each to appropriate format
5. Download all together

**Benefits:**
- Save time on large projects
- Consistent export settings
- Organized output
- Reduced manual work

## Export Options & Settings

### Filename Conventions

Exported files follow this pattern:
```
{originalName}_{YYYY-MM-DD}_translated.{ext}
```

**Examples:**
- `Genesis_2025-01-15_translated.docx`
- `Story01_2025-01-15_translated.md`
- `Documentary_2025-01-15_translated.vtt`

### Export Locations

- **Default:** Downloads folder
- **Custom:** Choose save location during export
- **Projects:** Can configure default export directory

### Handling Errors

**"File not imported with correct importer"**
- Solution: Re-import using the appropriate round-trip importer
- Files must have correct metadata for round-trip export

**"Export failed"**
- Check file permissions
- Verify disk space
- Try exporting individual files
- Check console for specific errors

**"Structure not found"**
- Original import metadata may be missing
- Re-import from original file
- Use standard export format as fallback

### Workflow 4: Multi-Book Project

1. **Project:** 10 Bible books translated
2. **Export:**
   - **Individual:** USFM for each book (consultant review)
   - **Combined:** HTML for all books (web preview)
   - **Backup:** Plain text for all (archival)
3. **Distribute:** Different formats to different stakeholders

## Best Practices

### Before Export

1. **Save your work** - Ensure all translations saved
2. **Review completeness** - Check for empty cells
3. **Run validation** - Use quality checks if available
4. **Test one file first** - Before batch export

### Choosing Format

1. **Round-trip needs?** - Use appropriate round-trip importer from the start
2. **Multiple audiences?** - Export to multiple formats
3. **File size concerns?** - Plain text is smallest
4. **Print publishing?** - Use IDML or USFM

### After Export

1. **Test the file** - Open in target application
2. **Verify formatting** - Check that structure is correct
3. **Keep originals** - Don't delete source files
4. **Document changes** - Note any manual edits needed
5. **Archive exports** - Keep dated versions

## Troubleshooting

### Export Errors

**Problem:** "Cannot export - importer type mismatch"

**Solution:**
- File was imported with wrong importer
- Re-import using correct round-trip importer
- Or use a standard export format instead

**Problem:** Export creates empty or corrupted file

**Solution:**
- Check that cells have content
- Verify metadata is intact
- Try exporting a single file first
- Check available disk space

**Problem:** Formatting lost in exported DOCX

**Solution:**
- Ensure you used "DOCX Round-trip" importer
- Standard DOCX importer doesn't preserve formatting
- Re-import original file with correct importer

### Format-Specific Issues

**DOCX Export**
- Images not appearing: Phase 3 feature (coming soon)
- Wrong formatting: Verify import used round-trip importer
- File won't open: Check Word version compatibility

**Subtitle Export**
- Timing wrong: Verify original timestamps weren't modified
- Missing subtitles: Check all cells have content
- Format not recognized: Ensure VTT/SRT format was detected

**USFM Export**
- Markers incorrect: Verify source was USFM import
- Missing verses: Check cell IDs follow verse pattern
- Invalid file: Validate structure before export

## FAQ

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Can I export to PDF directly?">
    Not directly from Codex. Export to DOCX or HTML first, then convert to PDF using Word or a web browser's "Print to PDF" function.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which format is best for archival?">
    Use **Plain Text** for long-term archival (universal compatibility) and **USFM** for Bible translations (industry standard). Keep original files as well.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I re-import exported files?">
    Yes, for round-trip formats (DOCX, IDML, OBS, Subtitles). Export preserves structure, so you can import, modify, and export again. Not recommended for plain text or HTML.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I export just one chapter?">
    Open the specific notebook file (e.g., `GEN.codex`), then export. To export specific verses, you'd need to create a custom notebook with only those cells.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize the export filename?">
    The filename is auto-generated with a timestamp. After export, you can rename the file as needed. The timestamp helps prevent overwriting previous exports.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I need a format not listed here?">
    Contact the development team or post in the Discord community. New exporters can be added to the plugin system. Meanwhile, export to a similar format and convert using other tools.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a way to preview before export?">
    Not currently. Best practice is to export one test file, verify the output, then batch export the rest.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How large can exported files be?">
    There's no strict limit, but very large files (100+ pages, 1000+ verses) may take longer to process. Consider splitting large books into smaller sections if performance is an issue.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
