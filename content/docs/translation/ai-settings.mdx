## Overview

Once you've created a project in Codex and imported your first source files, you can adjust your AI settings to customize how the AI assists with translations.

## Accessing Copilot Settings

1. Navigate to the **Codex main menu** in the top left corner
2. Scroll down and click on **Copilot Settings**

## Understanding the System Message

The **system message** (also called the AI prompt) is the set of instructions that guides how the AI translates your content. This message is **automatically generated** when you create your project, based on your source and target languages.

## Regenerating AI Instructions

If you want to refresh the AI instructions:

1. Click the **Sparkle button** in the Copilot Settings
2. The system will generate new instructions based on your current project configuration
3. This is useful if you've changed your project settings or want to start fresh

## Editing Instructions Manually

You and your team can customize the AI instructions to suit your specific needs:

- Edit the text in the instructions field
- Add style preferences (e.g., formal vs. contemporary language)
- Specify terminology handling
- Include cultural context or special requirements
- Think of these as instructions you'd give a human translator

### Example Customizations

**Style Preference:**
"Translate in a contemporary, easy-to-understand style similar to the Living Bible."

**Terminology:**
"Preserve technical biblical terms, but use modern language for everyday concepts."

**Cultural Context:**
"Adapt idioms and metaphors to be culturally relevant for the target audience."

## Saving Your Settings

After making any changes to your copilot settings:

1. Review your instructions
2. Click **Save** to apply the changes
3. The AI will use these updated instructions for all future translations

<Callout type="info">
All team members working on the project will use the same AI instructions, ensuring consistency across translations.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

- **Review auto-generated instructions**: The AI creates good defaults, but review them to ensure they match your goals
- **Be specific**: Clear, detailed instructions help the AI produce better translations
- **Test and refine**: Try translations with new settings and adjust as needed
- **Collaborate with your team**: Ensure everyone agrees on the translation approach
- **Regenerate when needed**: If you change languages or project settings, regenerate the instructions

## How AI Instructions Affect Translations

The copilot settings influence:
- Translation style and tone
- How technical terms are handled
- Cultural adaptation choices
- Formality level
- Consistency across the project

Think of these settings as the foundation for all AI-assisted work in your project.
