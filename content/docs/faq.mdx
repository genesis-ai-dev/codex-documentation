Here you can find the answers to the most common questions about Codex Editor. If you can't find what you're looking for, check our documentation, or contact support and we'll be happy to help you.

## Getting Started

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="What is a source text and a target text?">
    A source text is the original content you want to translate—like a Bible passage, subtitle file, or document. A target text *is the translation or transformed version of that content.<br/><br/>
    <img src="/images/example-ui.png" alt="Example showing source text on the left and target text on the right" style={{maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '8px'}} />
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I just created a project—what should I do next?">
    Start by importing your source files. Codex will automatically create blank target files that you can translate into or populate by importing existing translations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I import my files?">
    Click "Import Source Files" to add original texts. If you already have translations, use "Import Target Files" instead to align them with your source content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I import a file with the same name as one I already imported?">
    Codex will show a warning and ask if you want to overwrite the existing file. If confirmed, the original file will be replaced.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import more files later?">
    Yes. You can add source or target files anytime as your project grows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I have a partially complete translation from another tool?">
    Import it using the Target Files option. Codex will attempt to match your existing source content with the incoming translations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What file formats can I import?">
    Supported formats depend on available plugins, but include DOCX, SRT (subtitles), USFM, Markdown, and others. Click "Import Source Files" to view available importers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my source and target files don't align perfectly?">
    Codex matches content based on references, not just line numbers. Even imperfectly structured files can often be aligned effectively.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I undo or delete an import?">
    Not automatically—you'll need to manually delete any files you imported by mistake, or re-import a corrected version.
  </Accordion>
