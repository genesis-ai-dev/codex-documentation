## About Codex

Codex is a fork of [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), which is a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. This means that Codex is built from the same source code as Visual Studio Code, but without Microsoft's proprietary telemetry and branding. By using VSCodium as a foundation, Codex can offer a powerful and extensible editing experience while also integrating specialized features for our users.
