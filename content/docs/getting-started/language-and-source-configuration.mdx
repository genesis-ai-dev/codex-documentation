###
ai-instruction assistance works and ensures proper text handling for your specific language pair.

## Setting Source Language

Select your source language from the list or create a custom one if not available.

### Selection Process
1. Type the language name in the search field.
2. If not found, select '+Create Custom Language'.
3. Enter details for your custom language, including name, code, text direction, character set, and rules for punctuation, capitalization, numbers, and dates.
ai-instructions
For example, select English as source.

### Considerations
Consider regional differences and specific variants

Codex supports Unicode, automatic font selection, and various input methods. Account for text direction and cultural formatting conventions.

## Setting Target Language

Choose the language you're translating to, such as French.ai-instructions

After selection, proceed to source upload.

### Selection Process
Select from the database, choosing regional variants for your audience. This affects AI suggestions, text direction, and formatting.

## Importing Source Texts

Choose your import method:ai-instructions

2. Import a spreadsheet with columns for reference, source text, and optional target.

Source text is what you're translating from; translation is the target output.

3. Import a translation file. These are just like the files for importing source texts. For example: A .csv file may contain either the source or target language, or both.

### Configuration and Quality Control
Process options include verse detection, chapter breaks, formatting preservation, and reference systems (standard or custom).

After import, verify completeness, references, formatting, and navigation. Troubleshoot missing content, encoding, references, or formatting issues.

Best practices: Use descriptive names, consistent formatting, backups, and document settings. Preview imports, test sections, verify passages, and maintain version control.

## Downloading a Bible

Download a Bible from the cloud as source text.

### Download Process
1. Select a Bible in your source language (e.g., Bible in Basic English) from the library, which includes hundreds of translations, original texts, historical and modern versions.
2. Optionally, check 'Import as Translation Only' to populate existing content.
3. Click Download, monitor progress, and confirm after data gathering.

### Popular Versions
English (BBE, WEB, ASV, KJV), original languages (Hebrew Masoretic, Greek NT, Septuagai-instructions etc.).

### Troubleshooting
Troubleshoot slow/failed downloads by checking connection/storage, restarting, or clearing cache. Fix import issues with content, encoding, references, or display. [Report issues with importing here](/docs/project-management/reporting-bugs)
