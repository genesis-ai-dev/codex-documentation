## macOS Installation

### Determining Your Mac Type

Before downloading, you need to identify your Mac's processor type:

**Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3, M4 series)**
- Released 2020 or later
- Check: Apple Menu → About This Mac → look for "Apple M1", "Apple M2", etc.
- Or run in Terminal: `uname -m` (returns "arm64")

**Intel Macs**
- Released before 2020 (and some 2020 models)
- Check: Apple Menu → About This Mac → look for "Intel" processor
- Or run in Terminal: `uname -m` (returns "x86_64")

### Download Steps for macOS

1. Visit [codexeditor.app](https://codexeditor.app/)
2. Click the **macOS** button at the top of the page
3. Select your Mac type from the dropdown:
   - **Apple Silicon** - for M1, M2, M3, M4 Macs
   - **Intel** - for older Intel-based Macs
4. The download will begin automatically

### macOS Installation Process

1. Once downloaded, open the `.dmg` file
2. Drag Codex Editor to your Applications folder

## Windows Installation

### Download Steps for Windows

1. Visit [codexeditor.app](https://codexeditor.app/)
2. Click the **Windows** button at the top of the page
3. The download will start automatically (x64.exe file)

### Windows Installation Process

1. Locate the downloaded `.exe` file (usually in Downloads folder)
2. Double-click to run the installer
3. **Important**: You may see Windows security warnings

#### Handling Windows Security (Unsigned Application)

Windows may show security warnings because the application isn't code-signed:

1. **SmartScreen Warning**: If you see "Windows protected your PC"
   - Click "More info"
   - Click "Run anyway"
2. **User Account Control**: Allow the installer to make changes
3. Follow the installation wizard prompts

**What "Unsigned" Means**: The application doesn't have a digital signature from a recognized certificate authority(aka Microsoft). Windows flags this as potentially risky, but it's safe to proceed.

## Linux Installation

### Determining Your Linux Architecture

Before downloading, identify your system architecture:

```bash
# Check your architecture
uname -m
```

**Common Results:**
- `x86_64` → Choose **x64**
- `aarch64` → Choose **arm64**  
- `armv7l` → Choose **armhf**

### Download Steps for Linux

1. Visit [codexeditor.app](https://codexeditor.app/)
2. Click the **Linux** button at the top of the page
3. Select your architecture from the dropdown:
   - **x64** - Most common for desktop/laptop computers
   - **arm64** - For 64-bit ARM processors (like Raspberry Pi 4, Apple Silicon via emulation)
   - **armhf** - For 32-bit ARM processors (older Raspberry Pi models)

### Linux Installation Process

The exact installation method depends on the package format provided:

#### For .deb packages (Ubuntu/Debian):
```bash
sudo dpkg -i codex-editor*.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Fix dependencies if needed
```

#### For .AppImage files:
```bash
chmod +x codex-editor*.AppImage
./codex-editor*.AppImage
```

#### For .tar.gz archives:
```bash
tar -xzf codex-editor*.tar.gz
cd codex-editor
./codex-editor
```

#### Handling Linux Security (Unsigned Application)

Linux systems may require additional permissions:

1. **Executable Permissions**: You may need to make the file executable
   ```bash
   chmod +x codex-editor
   ```

2. **Package Manager Warnings**: Some package managers may warn about unsigned packages
   - This is normal for applications not in official repositories
   - Proceed with installation when prompted

**What "Unsigned" Means**: The package isn't signed with a recognized GPG key or distributed through official repositories. This is common for third-party applications.
