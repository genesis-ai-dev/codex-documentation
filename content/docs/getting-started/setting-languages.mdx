### Step 1: Access Language Settings
1. Navigate to your project settings
2. Look for the **"Languages"** or **"Language Configuration"** section
3. You'll see options for both source and target languages

### Step 2: Select Source Language
1. **Choose Source Language**: Select the language of your original text
   - Example: English, Greek, Hebrew, Spanish, etc.
   - This is the language you're translating FROM
   - Ensure you select the correct variant if multiple options exist

2. **Source Language Considerations**:
   - Choose the most specific variant available
   - Consider regional differences (e.g., American vs. British English)
   - For biblical texts, consider ancient vs. modern language variants

### Step 3: Select Target Language
1. **Choose Target Language**: Select the language you're translating TO
   - Example: French, Swahili, Mandarin, etc.
   - This determines the AI's translation suggestions
   - Affects text direction and formatting

2. **Target Language Options**:
   - Select from the extensive language database
   - Choose regional variants when available
   - Consider your target audience's specific dialect

## Creating Custom Languages

### When to Create Custom Languages
- Your target language isn't in the standard list
- You need a specific dialect or regional variant
- Working with a minority or indigenous language
- Require specialized terminology handling

### Custom Language Creation Process
1. **Access Custom Language Option**: Look for "Create Custom Language" or similar
2. **Define Language Properties**:
   - Language name and code
   - Text direction (left-to-right or right-to-left)
   - Character set and encoding
   - Regional and cultural considerations

3. **Configure Language Rules**:
   - Punctuation conventions
   - Capitalization rules
   - Number formatting
   - Date and time formats

## Language-Specific Features

### Text Direction Support
- **Left-to-Right**: Most European and many other languages
- **Right-to-Left**: Arabic, Hebrew, and related languages
- **Mixed Direction**: Documents with multiple language directions

### Character Set Handling
- **Unicode Support**: Full support for international characters
- **Font Requirements**: Automatic font selection for proper display
- **Input Methods**: Support for various keyboard layouts and input systems

### Cultural Considerations
- **Formatting Conventions**: Date, time, and number formats
- **Punctuation Rules**: Language-specific punctuation handling
- **Capitalization**: Proper noun and sentence capitalization rules

## AI Translation Optimization

### Language Pair Quality
Different language pairs have varying levels of AI support:
- **High Support**: Major world languages with extensive training data
- **Medium Support**: Regional languages with moderate training data
- **Developing Support**: Minority languages with growing support

### Improving AI Performance
1. **Provide Context**: Use clear, contextual source texts
2. **Consistent Terminology**: Maintain consistent translation choices
3. **Cultural Adaptation**: Guide AI toward culturally appropriate translations
4. **Feedback Loop**: Correct AI suggestions to improve future predictions

## Common Language Configurations

### Biblical Translation Projects
- **Source**: Ancient Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, or modern language Bibles
- **Target**: Local or regional languages
- **Considerations**: Theological terminology, cultural context

### Literary Translation
- **Source**: Original publication language
- **Target**: Reader's native language
- **Considerations**: Style preservation, cultural references

### Technical Documentation
- **Source**: Usually English or other major languages
- **Target**: Local business or academic languages
- **Considerations**: Technical terminology, precision

## Troubleshooting Language Settings

### Language Not Available
- Check for alternative names or spellings
- Look for broader language categories
- Consider creating a custom language
- Contact support for language additions

### Incorrect AI Suggestions
- Verify source and target language settings
- Check for regional variant mismatches
- Review custom language configurations
- Provide feedback to improve AI performance

### Text Display Issues
- Ensure proper font support is installed
- Check text direction settings
- Verify character encoding settings
- Test with sample text before proceeding

## Best Practices

### Language Selection
- Choose the most specific variant available
- Consider your target audience's preferences
- Test with sample translations before committing
- Document your language choices for team consistency

### Team Coordination
- Ensure all team members use the same language settings
