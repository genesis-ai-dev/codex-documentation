If you're experiencing syncing issues with your project—such as error messages appearing in the bottom right saying the project isn't syncing, or team members not seeing your changes—the project healing feature can resolve these problems.

## When to Use Project Healing

Use the project healing feature when:
- You see sync error messages in the bottom right
- Team members aren't seeing your changes
- Pressing the sync button doesn't resolve the issue
- The project hasn't synced for several minutes

## Before You Start: Create a Backup

<Callout type="warning">
Always create a backup before healing your project so you don't lose your changes if something goes wrong
</Callout>

### 1. Close Your Project

- Close your current project if it's open
- This ensures any unsaved changes are preserved in the local files

### 2. Access Project Options

- From the project list, find your problematic project
- Click the down arrow next to the project name
- This reveals additional project management options

### 3. Create a Manual Backup

- Click "Download as ZIP" to create a backup
- Choose the "mini version" option to save essential content only
- Save the backup file to your downloads folder or preferred location
- This backup is in addition to the automatic backup the healing process creates

## Healing Your Project

### 4. Initiate Project Healing

- In the project options, look for the "Heal Project" button
- Click this button to start the healing process
- Confirm when prompted to proceed

### 5. Understanding the Healing Process

The healing process automatically:
1. **Creates a backup** of your current project state
2. **Deletes the main project folder** to remove corrupted sync data
3. **Re-clones the entire project** from the server with fresh sync information
4. **Restores your local changes** that weren't yet synced to the server
5. **Transfers audio files** and other media that may not have synced

### 6. Wait for Completion

- The process will show progress as it works
- Wait for the "cloned successfully" message
- The healing feature creates its own backup, but your manual backup provides extra security

## After Healing

### 7. Reopen Your Project

- Open the healed project as normal
- The project will automatically perform a sync
- Your previously unsynced changes should now upload to the server

### 8. Verify Your Content

- Check that your recent changes are present and correct
- Navigate to the areas you were working on before the sync issues
- Confirm that audio recordings and other media files are intact
- Team members should now be able to see your updates

## What Gets Restored

The healing process preserves:
- **Text changes** that weren't yet synced
- **Audio recordings** you've made locally  
- **Project settings** and configurations
- **Translation progress** and work completed

## Need Additional Help?

If project healing doesn't resolve your sync issues:
- Contact technical support with your backup files

- Describe the specific sync errors you were experiencing

The project healing feature is designed to resolve most sync-related issues while preserving your work and maintaining project integrity.
