Once you've logged into Codex, you'll see the project setup screen displaying all available projects.

## Understanding the Project Screen

The project setup screen shows three types of projects:

### Local Projects (Gray)
Projects that exist only on your machine and haven't been synced with any teams. These are private to your computer.

### Team Projects (Blue)
Projects that have been synced with other teams. The blue indicator shows they're connected to a shared workspace.

### Remote Projects
Projects you've been invited to but haven't downloaded yet. These show a **Clone** option, allowing you to download them to your local machine.

## Filtering Your Projects

You can sort and filter projects using the view options:

- **Available Locally**: Shows all projects downloaded to your computer
- **Local Only**: Projects that exist only on this machine (not yet published to teams)
- **Remote**: Projects you've been invited to but haven't downloaded yet

## Creating a New Project

Creating a project is straightforward:

1. Click the **Create New Project** button
2. Enter your project name (e.g., "The Cool Project")
3. Your project will be created instantly

That's it! Your new project is ready to go.

## Next Steps

After creating your project, you'll configure:

1. **[Source Language](/docs/project-management/source-and-target-languages)**: The language you're translating from
2. **[Target Language](/docs/project-management/source-and-target-languages)**: The language you're translating to
3. **[Import Source Files](/docs/project-management/importing-files)**: Add your source texts to begin translation

Your new project will appear as a gray (local) project until you choose to sync it with a team.
