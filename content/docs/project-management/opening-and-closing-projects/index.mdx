This guide provides a step-by-step demonstration on how to open and close projects in Codex, ensuring your work is saved and projects are managed efficiently.

### Closing a Project

<Callout type="warning">
Always save your work before closing the project to avoid losing any unsaved changes. If you have an open editing cell, save it first by selecting the checkmark in the top right corner of the cell. If you have not made any changes then the checkmark will not appear.
</Callout>

1. Locate and open the main menu on the side panel.

2. Scroll down to the bottom of the menu.

3. Click the "Close Project" button (indicated by an X icon).

4. Confirm the action in the prompt that appears. Ensure all ongoing work is saved, particularly if you have an open cell you're editing.

5. Once confirmed, the project will close, and you'll be directed to the startup screen displaying your project list.

### Opening a Project

1. From the startup screen, view the list of available projects. This includes cloud projects (if you have a Codex cloud subscription) or local projects.

2. Select the project you wish to open by clicking on it.

3. The project will load, restoring everything exactly as it was when you last closed it.

### Additional Information

- The startup screen also provides an option to create a new project.
- Always save your work before closing to avoid data loss.
- If you have a cloud subscription, your projects sync across devices for seamless access.
