When initializing a project in Codex, one of the first steps is selecting your source and target languages.

## Setting Initial Languages

### Source Language
The **Source Language** is the language you are translating *from*.
- Example: If translating from Spanish to English, select **Spanish** as the Source Language.
- You can search for languages in the provided menu.

### Target Language
The **Target Language** is the language you are translating *to*.
- Example: If translating from Spanish to English, select **English** as the Target Language.
- Codex provides a comprehensive list of languages.
- **Custom Languages:** You can also create a custom language if your specific target language is not listed.

## Changing Languages After Setup

If you need to change your language settings after the initial project setup:

1.  Open the **Sidebar Menu** (top left).
2.  Look for the **Source Language** and **Target Language** settings.
3.  Click the **Edit Icon** next to the language you want to change.
4.  Select the new language from the list (or create a custom one).

> **Note:** It is important to set up these languages according to the documents you have on hand. Your Source Language setting should match the language of the source text you plan to import.

## Next Steps

Once your languages are configured, you will proceed to upload your source text.
