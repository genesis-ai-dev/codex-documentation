### 1. Accessing Developer Tools

When you encounter an issue or bug in Codex, capturing console logs can help our support team diagnose and fix the problem more quickly.

**Opening Developer Tools:**
- Click on **Help** at the top of the screen
- Look for the button to **Toggle Developer Tools**
- On Mac: The interface may look slightly different
- On Windows: The layout might vary from Mac

### 2. Understanding the Developer Tools Interface

Once you open the developer tools, they may appear in different locations:
- As a **sidebar** on the right
- As a **separate window**
- At the **bottom** of the screen

All of these locations work fine for accessing the console.

### 3. Finding the Console Tab

**Locating the Console:**
- Look for a menu called **Console** in the developer tools
- You may need to click the **arrows** to expand the menu options
- Select **Console** from the available tabs

### 4. Reading Console Messages

The console displays different types of messages:

**Message Types:**
- **Yellow messages:** Warning messages (usually not critical)
- **Red messages:** Error messages (these are what we need for bug reports)
- **Other colors:** Various informational messages

### 5. Capturing Error Messages

When you encounter a bug or issue:

**Reproducing the Error:**
1. Try to perform the action that caused the problem
2. Watch the console for any **red error messages**
3. These errors will appear in real-time as you interact with the application

**Copying Error Messages:**
1. **Select the error message** in the console
2. **Expand the error** if there's a dropdown arrow to see more details
3. **Copy the entire error message** including any expanded details
4. **Send the error message** to our support team

### 6. Best Practices for Bug Reporting

**What to Include:**
- The complete error message from the console
- A description of what you were trying to do when the error occurred
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any relevant project information

**Before Reporting:**
- Try to reproduce the error to confirm it's consistent
- Check if there are multiple error messages related to the same issue
- Take note of any patterns or specific actions that trigger the error
- Search our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/6kVJTEXYEp) to see if others have encountered similar issues

### 7. When to Check Console Logs

**Recommended Times:**
- When you encounter unexpected behavior
- When features aren't working as expected
- When the application becomes unresponsive
- Before reporting any issues to support

**Proactive Monitoring:**
- Keep the developer tools open while working if you're experiencing intermittent issues
- Check the console periodically during intensive work sessions
- Clear the console (if needed) before testing specific features

### 8. Getting Help

Once you've captured the error messages:
- Send them to our support team along with your bug report
- Include the steps you took that led to the error
- Mention your operating system and Codex version if known
- Our team can use this information to investigate and resolve the issue more effectively
