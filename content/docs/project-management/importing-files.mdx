title: Importing Source Files
description: Learn how to import various file formats into Codex Editor including Word documents, subtitles, Bible texts, and more
---

Codex Editor supports importing a wide variety of file formats for translation projects. Whether you're working with Bible texts, documents, subtitles, or structured data, the import system automatically detects and processes your files.

## Understanding Source vs Target Import

Before importing, it's important to understand the two types of imports:

**Source Import** - Import original content that you want to translate
- Creates a new source file (read-only reference)
- Automatically creates a blank target file for your translation
- Use this for: Bible texts, documents you're translating, video subtitles

**Target Import** - Import existing translations for source files already in your project
- Matches translated content to existing source files
- Populates your target notebook with translations
- Use this for: partially completed translations, importing work from other tools

## Opening the Import Interface

1. Click the **Compass icon** in the sidebar to open Navigation
2. Click **"Add Files"** or **"Import Source Files"** button
3. The import wizard will guide you through the process

## Choosing Your Import Type

### Option 1: Import New Source Files

Use this when you're starting fresh or adding new content to translate:

1. Select **"Source Files"** in the wizard
2. Browse available importers (see supported formats below)
3. Upload your file(s)
4. Codex creates both source and target notebooks automatically

### Option 2: Import Translations

Use this when you have existing translations to bring into Codex:

1. Select **"Target Files"** in the wizard
2. Choose which source file this translation belongs to
3. Select the appropriate importer
4. The system aligns your translation with the source content

**Tip:** If you're importing a translation, make sure you've already imported the corresponding source file first. The wizard will show you which source files are available.

## Advanced Import Features

### Batch Import (Multiple Files)

- Drag and drop multiple files at once
- Use ZIP archives for organized imports
- System processes files in parallel

### Alignment Algorithms

When importing translations (Target Import), Codex uses intelligent alignment:

**ID-Based Matching**
- Matches by verse references (for Bible texts)
- Matches by cell IDs (for structured content)
- **Accuracy:** Very high for properly structured files

**Sequential Insertion**
- Fills empty cells in order
- Used for content without IDs (DOCX, Markdown, plain text)
- **Accuracy:** Good for similar-length translations

**Timestamp-Based (Subtitles)**
- Matches by time overlap
- Handles complex 1:many and many:1 mappings
- **Accuracy:** Excellent for time-synced content

### Preview & Confirm

For translation imports, you can:
- Preview alignment results before applying
- See matched vs paratext content statistics
- Try different alignment methods
- Review confidence scores

## Troubleshooting Import Issues

### Import Fails or File Not Recognized

**Problem:** File won't import or shows an error

**Solutions:**
- Verify the file format is supported (check file extension)
- Try using the "Smart Segmenter" for unusual text formats
- Check that the file isn't corrupted (open in original application)
- Ensure the file isn't password-protected or encrypted

### Translation Import Shows Poor Alignment

**Problem:** Imported translation doesn't match source content well

**Solutions:**
- Try a different alignment method in the preview screen
- Verify you selected the correct source file
- Check that source and translation have similar structure
- Consider manual alignment for complex cases

### Images or Formatting Lost

**Problem:** Images or formatting didn't import

**Solutions:**
- Use the "Round-trip" importer versions (DOCX, IDML)
- Standard importers focus on text content only
- Images should appear in `.project/attachments/` folder
- Some formatting is intentionally simplified for translation

### Duplicate File Warning

**Problem:** System warns that a file with this name already exists

**Solutions:**
- Rename the new file if it's different content
- Overwrite if you want to replace the existing file
- Cancel and review your existing files first

## Best Practices

### Before Importing

1. **Organize your files** with clear, descriptive names
2. **Check file formats** are supported
3. **Backup important files** before conversion
4. **Review file quality** (no corruption, proper encoding)

### During Import

1. **Use appropriate importers** (Round-trip for exports, specific parsers for accuracy)
2. **Preview alignment results** for translation imports
3. **Check cell counts** to ensure complete import
4. **Verify structure** looks correct before proceeding

### After Import

1. **Review imported content** for accuracy
2. **Check metadata** (book names, cell IDs, timestamps)
3. **Test export** if using round-trip workflow
4. **Begin translation** with confidence!

## FAQ

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Can I import multiple books at once?">
    Yes! You can drag and drop multiple files, or use a ZIP archive containing multiple books. The system will process each file separately and create individual notebook pairs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I make a mistake during import?">
    Original files are preserved in `.project/attachments/originals/`. You can delete the imported notebooks and re-import with different settings. However, any translation work you've done would need to be redone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import from Paratext?">
    Yes! Use the "Paratext Project" importer. You can import either a project folder or a ZIP export from Paratext. All SFM files and project settings will be processed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know which importer to use?">
    The import wizard shows descriptions and tags for each importer. Look for:
    - "Round-trip" tag if you need to export back to the original format
    - Format-specific importers for best accuracy
    - "Smart Segmenter" as a fallback for unusual formats
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import my own recordings or audio files?">
    Yes! Place audio files in `.project/attachments/{BOOK}/` following the naming convention `{BOOK}_{CCC}_{VVV}.wav` (e.g., `GEN_001_001.wav` for Genesis 1:1). See our [Audio Translation guide](/docs/translation/video-audio-translation#audio-recording) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to images in imported documents?">
    Images are extracted and stored in `.project/attachments/` organized by document. For DOCX and Markdown files, images are embedded in cells. For round-trip workflows (DOCX, IDML, OBS), images are preserved for export.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I import translations from other CAT tools?">
    If you can export to a supported format (USFM, DOCX, CSV, etc.), yes! Use the "Target Files" import option and Codex will align the translation with your source content.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
