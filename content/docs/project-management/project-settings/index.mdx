Project settings are the control center for your translation work in Codex Editor. Proper configuration ensures optimal AI performance, team collaboration, and translation quality.

## Accessing Project Settings

After importing sources, close the tab to reach the welcome view.

From there:
1. Open the main menu.
2. You'll see sections: Translations, Project Settings, Parallel Passages, and Comments.
3. Select Project Settings to view and configure.

Alternative access:
- From Project Dashboard: Click the settings gear icon
- From Translation View: Access through the toolbar

## Viewing Basic Information

In Project Settings, you'll see:
- Project name (e.g., Awesome Project)
- Source language (e.g., English)
- Target language (e.g., French)

Setting the source and target languages properly is the primary way to inform the AI about translation requirements.

## Uploading Additional Files

To upload more files:
1. Click on 'Project Documents'.
2. This returns you to the upload page for importing additional sources.

## Additional Configuration

Project settings include categories for:
- Basic Information: Name, description, tags
- Languages: Source and target configuration
- AI Settings: Copilot configuration (see [Configuring AI Copilot Settings](/docs/translation/copilot-ai-configuration))
- Collaboration: Team access and permissions
- Export Options: Output formats

## Advanced Settings

- Technical: Backups, storage, performance
- Customization: Interface, shortcuts, display

## Validation and Best Practices

Verify settings before translating. Plan configurations, document decisions, review regularly.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues: AI not working (check languages), access problems (verify permissions).
