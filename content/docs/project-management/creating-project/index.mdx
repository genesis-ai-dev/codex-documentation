Projects are the foundation of your translation work in Codex Editor. Each project contains your source texts, translations, settings, and collaboration tools. This guide will walk you through creating your first project.

## Project Management Overview

When you first log in, you'll see a list of projects local to your computer (not visible to others).

You can:
- Create a new empty project.
- Join an existing project (requires being added to the organization/group).

For organizations and groups, use the website to set up (link can be provided). Create teams, nested subgroups, and projects there, or directly in the app.

For local projects:
- Click 'Open' to access.
- Delete projects as needed.
- Cloud icon indicates available projects not yet downloaded.

## Creating Your First Project

1. Click to create a new project.
2. Name your project (e.g., 'Awesome Project'). Spaces are replaced with dashes.
3. Let it start up.
4. Click 'Initialize Project' to set it up.
