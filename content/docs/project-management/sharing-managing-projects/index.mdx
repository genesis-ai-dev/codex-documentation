> In this guide, we focus on managing projects, teams, members, and access. We use the Global Bible Tools organization as a sample to demonstrate creating teams, managing access, and publishing to subgroups. The same steps will apply to your own organization.

### 1. Introduction to Project Sharing

- Overview of sharing a project using a cloud-based management tool.
- Example group used in this guide: Global Bible Tools.

### 2. Accessing the Group

- Navigate to your organization/group page with a simple edit to this url git.genesisrnd.com/groups/input_your_orginization_name_here 
(for example: "git.genesisrnd.com/groups/GlobalBibleTools")

### 3. Managing Group Members

- Click on 'Manage Members' to add new members to the group.
- Assign roles: Developer, Maintainer, or Owner for project updates.

### 4. Creating Subgroups for Specific Languages

- Create subgroups within your organization for specific languages (e.g., Portuguese).
- Subgroups help manage access and reduce confusion.

### 5. Publishing Projects

- Steps to create and publish a project: 
  - Initialize a new project (e.g., Test Project).
  - Set source language (e.g., Biblical Hebrew, Koine Greek) and target language (e.g., Portuguese).
  - Upload source files.

### 6. Project Settings and Publishing

- Access project settings to publish the project.
- Ensure the project is published under the correct subgroup (e.g., Portuguese).

### 7. Syncing Projects

- Understand the syncing process: 
  - Projects can be synced to the cloud.
  - Manual sync option available.

### 8. Collaboration and Version Control

- Multiple users can work on the same project simultaneously.
- Use version history to track changes and resolve conflicts.
