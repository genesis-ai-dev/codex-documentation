### Overview

The Migration Tool allows you to copy and transfer your translation data, validations, and edits from one target file to another target file. This is useful when you need to move your work to a different file structure or format.

### How to Access the Migration Tool

1. Navigate to your **Main Menu**
2. Scroll down to find the **Migration Tool** button
3. Click to open the Migration Tool interface

### Migration Process

#### 1. Select Your Source File

- In the first selection box, choose the file you want to **migrate from**
- This is the file containing the translation data you want to copy

#### 2. Select Your Destination File

- In the second selection box, choose the file you want to **migrate to**
- This is where your translation data will be copied

#### 3. Choose Your Matching Method

The Migration Tool offers different ways to match source and target cells:

**Match Timestamps:**
- Use this option for VTT subtitle files or other time-based content
- Matches cells based on their timestamps
- Ideal for video/audio translation projects

**Match Global References:**
- Use this option for content with references like verse numbers
- Matches cells based on their reference identifiers
- Useful for structured documents with numbered sections

**Match Sequential Source Lines:**
- Matches cells in order (Cell 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on)
- Use when cells don't have timestamps or references
- Good for simple sequential content

#### 4. Run the Migration

1. Select your preferred matching method
2. Click the **Migrate** button
3. Wait for the process to complete
4. You'll see a confirmation message: "Your validations and your edits have been successfully migrated"

### What Gets Migrated

When you run the migration tool, the following data is transferred:
- Translation text
- Validations
- Edits and modifications

### Tips for Successful Migration

- Make sure both files use compatible structures for the matching method you choose
- Verify that your destination file is ready to receive the migrated data
- Always review the migrated content after the process completes
- Keep backups of your original files before performing migrations
