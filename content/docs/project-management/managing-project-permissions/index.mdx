> This guide demonstrates how to manage groups, permissions, and member access for Codex projects. Learn how to create subgroups, assign roles, and control who can access specific projects within your organization.

**Understanding User Roles**

Before managing permissions, it's helpful to understand the different role types:
- **Owner** - Full control over organization, subgroups, and projects
- **Maintainer** - Can manage subgroups and projects, invite members
- **Developer** - Can create, edit, and translate within projects
- **Reporter** - Read-only access for review and reporting purposes

### 1. Understanding Organization Structure

Your Codex organization can contain:
- **Projects** - Individual translation projects
- **Subgroups** - Folders that organize projects by language, team, or purpose
- **Members** - Users with different permission levels

At the organization level, you can create multiple folders and add people to those folders. These folders could be for specific projects, groups of projects, specific languages, or whatever organizational structure makes sense for your team.

### 2. Adding Members at Organization Level

To add a manager or team member to your organization:

1. Navigate to your organization page
2. Click **Manage** → **Members**
3. Click **Invite Member**
4. Type in their name to find their account
5. Select the appropriate role:
   - **Owner** - Full administrative access
   - **Maintainer** - Can manage groups and projects
   - **Developer** - Can work on projects
   - **Reporter** - Limited access for viewing

### 3. Creating Subgroups for Project Organization

To create organized folders for your projects (e.g., by language):

1. From your organization main page
2. Click **Create Subgroup**
3. Name your subgroup (e.g., "French Projects")
4. This creates a dedicated folder where you can:
   - Publish projects from Codex
   - Control access for specific team members
   - Organize projects by language or team

When publishing from Codex, these subgroups will appear in your list of available places to publish, but only if you're logged into an account with access.

### 4. Managing Subgroup Permissions

Once inside a subgroup (like "French Projects"):

1. Click **Manage** → **Members**
2. Click **Invite Members** to add people specifically to this subgroup
3. Select the appropriate role:
   - **Developer** - For translators who will be creating new content and making changes
   - **Reporter** - For reviewers with limited access
4. Click **Invite** to add them to the subgroup

### 5. Understanding Permission Inheritance

Members can be added at different levels:

- **Organization Level** - These members automatically have access to all subgroups and projects
- **Subgroup Level** - These members only have access to projects within that specific subgroup

If you see members in a subgroup that you can't directly remove, they likely have permissions inherited from the organization level.

### 6. Modifying and Removing Member Access

To change a member's permissions:
1. Navigate to **Manage** → **Members**
2. Find the member you want to modify
3. Change their role using the dropdown menu
4. To remove them entirely, click **Remove Member**

**Important:** If a member was added at the organization level, you must go back to the organization's member management to remove their access completely.

### 7. Best Practices for Permission Management

- **Use subgroups** to organize projects by language, team, or project type
- **Assign appropriate roles** - developers for translators, reporters for reviewers
- **Add members at the lowest level needed** - organization-wide access should be limited
- **Regularly review permissions** to ensure team members have appropriate access
- **Use the inheritance system** - add managers at organization level, translators at subgroup level

This permission system ensures that your translation teams have appropriate access while maintaining security and organization across your projects.
